# nvim
This is my active work for a neovim configuration. the current emphasis is that it works well for Rust and LUA.

plugins are defined in ```plugins.lua```. at the moment the plugins are set to install in standard XDG directorys. so in my case it is ```~/.local/share/```. keymaps are in a seperate config file called ```keymaps.lua```. this time i have a seperate file for options aptly titled ```options.lua```.
