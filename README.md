# My Neovim Configuration.
This is my active work for a working neovim configuration. this is currently not being done based on any one particular tutorial series as a result this is noticibaly more custom. though i did borrow from some of the previous work i had done where things worked nicely. this is also serving as an excuse for me to learn the git command line since i am going to be spending a lot of time in a terminal anyway.
